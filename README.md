# Projects in Matlab

by Spencer Johnson 
during the years of 2022-2024

The following repositiory is used for the math practices throughout university

## System requirements

* [Matlab](https://matlab.mathworks.com)

## Related Packages

* Multivariable Optimization (Calculus)
    * Given a function of x and y, we will use a descent algorithm to determine when the function has convered at a minima
        * Generate_fxy.m (code provided to generate the different types of functions)
        * Gradient_Descent-2.m (code completed by the group using descent algorithm)

* Spam Filter (Statistics)
    * Given a set of strings, our system will classify them as spam messages or normal messages
        * code.m (the code completed by our group)
        * resources (a folder of resources provided to utilize)
